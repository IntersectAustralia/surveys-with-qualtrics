# Getting started with Qualtrics
## Intersect's introductory Qualtrics course for researchers

Researchers will build a survey in Qualtrics based on a cultural food studies project. The survey will gather information about people’s food choices and habits, dietary requirements and ethical considerations, and seek to identify any emerging trends in the response data.
This mini research project enables attendees to explore the features of Qualtrics without having to be an expert in the subject area. The resulting basic survey will demonstrate various fundamental features of Qualtrics, such as display and skip logic, blocks and pagination, and range of question types.
Having developed the basic survey, attendees will be shown how to distribute it using several methods, as well as the benefits and consequences of the different distribution methods.
Lastly, after some sample data has been collected (from other participants in the class), attendees will be shown how to view responses, filter responses and run reports and exports for analysis.


By the end of this workshop, students will know:

- learn how to construct a basic, “flat” survey in Qualtrics, including exploring skip and display logic and branching features;
- learn how to change the look and feel of the survey;
- learn how to distribute the survey via email, social media, text message or anonymous link; and,
- learn how to break a longer survey up into manageable units using blocks
