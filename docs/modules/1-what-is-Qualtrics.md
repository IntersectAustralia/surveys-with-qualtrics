## Logging into Qualtrics
Some universities will have LDAP ("Lightweight Directory Access Protocol") integration, meaning that you will be able to log in with your university credentials. If you're university hasn't configured this, then you will have to create an account before logging in.

## Intersect's recommendations
### When to use Qualtrics?
* When you have a range of respondent groups who you want to survey and you want to cater for all in a single survey. Qualtrics allows for sophisticated survey designs.
* When you want to quickly deploy a survey. Qualtrics is a reasonably intuitive platform when it comes to building your survey, allowing for you to do this pretty quickly.
* When you want to build real-time dashboards of your survey responses to monitor responses as they come in.
* When you want a basic all-in-one survey tool to collect data, analyse and export.

### When not to use Qualtrics
* When you are dealing with highly sensitive and identifiable data. There are Australian laws and regulations that prohibit storing data about Australian people overseas. While Qualtrics has data centres on Australian soil, it is not necessarily the case that your institution's account is held here. You can find out this information by asking your institution's license holder.
